# QuestZone
QuestZone is a fork of QuestionsJS.

#### Goal
Our goal is to build a anonymous question system specifically for the classroom environment.

#### Why QuestZone?
> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
